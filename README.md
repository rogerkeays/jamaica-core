Jamaica Core Functions: Simplified Java development

  APIs should be written for humans
  models look great, but don't do much
  functions are infinitely more valuable than models
  functions are the best unit of code reuse
  mixing verbs and nouns is a recipe for code soup
  inheritence is the worst form of code coupling
  tests belong next to the code they test
  the simplest solution is always the best
  snake_case is easier to read than camelCase
  long symbol names are not a problem
  we haven't progressed much since C
  checked exceptions are impractical
  "Util" functions are real code, not utilities
  any black magic is bad
  frameworks lock you in and steal the best years of your life
  every solution creates a problem
  an API will never be just how you want it
  don't throw the baby out with the bath water
  the tag TODO has no place in source code
  declarative languages are brittle
  if you need an IDE, your language is too complex
  annotations and setters are a good place to hide black magic
  only static methods are allowed
