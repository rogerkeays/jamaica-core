All the things that Java says you don't need, but you really do.

- an API will never be just how you want it
- don't throw the baby out with the bath water
- the tag TODO has no place in source code
- declarative languages are brittle
- if you need an IDE, your language is too complex
- annotations and setters are a good place to hide black magic
